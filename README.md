#### Description:
Hi! This is Muhammad Hanzala Khan. I am 15 years old and I am a CS50 student.

I have created this CS50 Final Project using different web-based languages.
Basically my project is a collection of two web-applications and an index page with some professional effects.
I have created this project using HTML, CSS, and Javascript. I used Javascript for the calculations of
my web-applications.
  INDEX PAGE:
In my index page, I have created a nice scrolling effect. I stylized the page using different images
and CSS and add the effect using Javascript.
I linked the Cascading Style Sheets using html syntax. Classes were made alot in the index page
to stylize the code. In index.js functions have been used such as "getElementById" inorder to do the
scrolling effect. You can also check the source code inorder to understand
the structure of the web page.
Calculator:
From, index or home page, you can navigate into Calculator page. The calculator page is a
web-application which performs all the arithmetic operations including addition, subtraction,
multiplication and division. It can also perform scientific operations such as log, and can also
calculate trignometric ratios such as sin, cos, and tan. I created this using Javascript.
I used Math.sin() function inorder to do the calculations. ( I got this function from w3schools.)
  Digital Clock:
From, index or home page, you can also navigate into Digital Clock page. I created this
using Javascript and stylized the text, and numbers using CSS. I took help from w3schools to
develop this web-application.
  Simple Calculator:
 This is a simple version of my first web application that is a scientific calculator.
 In this application I have again used Javascript as the programming language to do the calculations of the program.
 User inputs data by clicking on buttons and then Javascript plays it's role. I created and used different
 functions to achive the task.


Some info about Javascript:
JavaScript is a light-weight object-oriented programming language that is used by several websites
for scripting the webpages. It is an interpreted, full-fledged programming language. JavaScript
enables dynamic interactivity on websites when it is applied to an HTML document.



Use Of Javascript:
JavaScript is commonly used for creating web pages. It allows us to add dynamic behavior to the webpage and add special effects to the webpage.
On websites, it is mainly used for validation purposes. JavaScript helps us to execute complex
actions and also enables the interaction of websites with visitors. Using JavaScript, it is also
possible to load the content in a document without reloading the webpage.

 I hope that you will like my project. I tried my best to do it. Best Of luck to CS50 for it's journey.
